# 10 Days Of Data Structure
Inspired by my Minerva peer @papapalapa, I'm going to start my own 10-days-of-data-structure-challenge --- to build a stronger knowledge foundation in CS in a structure way. 
All the resources I use will be open source, and any student (or professional) is free to follow along, copy, change, criticize, or whatever you want to do with this repository. 

## Rule
1. Don't spend more than two hours per day. Be consistent and think in the long run.
2. Find a friend you can discuss about Computer Science. If you cannot find a friend, email me. Although I'm a novice as well, I'll be down to help you.
3. Be a critical thinker on knowledge I've learned.
4. Extend this challenge and modify as your own
5. Help me improve this content.

## Day 1
#### Goal
1. Review what my previous knowledge on data structures, and how should I design my 10 days of challenges. 
2. Learned Heaps.
